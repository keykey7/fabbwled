        A narrow path leads up the hill, the top of which is crowned
        with a circle of large obsidian standing stones, hewn from solid
        rock. Despite the bitter wind that blows across these hills, the
        stones are unweathered and seem but newly lain. They form
        three archways, each carved with mystic symbols and runes of
        power.
