        Suddenly you shoot into bright sunlight, and land with an
        almighty splash into the sea! Coughing and spluttering, you rise
        to the surface. You are not far from a forested island, and you
        swim for shore. A small settlement crowds the shore – it looks
        like you have arrived at the Trading Post on the Isle of Druids.

        You were given the message to take to the king by some spies in Golnir. 
        The king takes the coded missive. Cross it off your Adventure Sheet. 
        He hands it to one of his counsellors to read. ‘You have done well in bringing this to me. 
        It is important,’ says the king. You are rewarded with 200 Shards.

            If not, the king goes on, ‘However, I was hoping you had spoken with General Beladai of the 
            allied army by now –
            we need that citadel. Now go. That is a Royal command!’ 
            You leave, climbing down to the foothills of the mountains.

        You are dead. If you have a resurrection deal, 
        turn to the section noted on your Adventure Sheet after first erasing your current possessions, 
        money, and any details on your Ship’s Manifest. If you don’t have a resurrection arranged, 
        this is the end and you can only start afresh with a new character. 
        First make sure to erase all ticks, codewords, and Adventure Sheet details in all your Fabled Lands books.
        You can begin at 1 in any of the books of the series.
