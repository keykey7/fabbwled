        You find a shadowy natural alcove in the rocky wall of a tunnel.
        Desperately, you squeeze yourself into it, using all your skill to hide in the darkness.
        Several ratmen run past, but others sniff you out with their highly developed sense of smell.
        You are overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

        You tell him who you are, and that General Grieve Marlock’s brother, the Governor of Yellowport, is your personal friend.
        His eyes widen as recognition dawns on his fat, greedy face.
        ‘Ah, er... my lord!,’ he cries. ‘I was merely jesting! Umm....
        We were, I mean to say, perhaps you need an escort?’
        ‘I think we require a levy in order to carry out the important mission the governor has entrusted to me,’ you say.
        ‘Sixty Shards ought to do it, Captain!’
        The Sokaran captain hands over the 60 Shards (add it to your Adventure Sheet) and leads his men off your ship.
        You sail on.

        You are thrown into a stinking prison cell.
        ‘Well, well, we meet again, my old friend,’ says a half-dead old man with white hair.
        You recognize the poor old man whom you met the last time you were thrown into the dungeons!
        He launches into the same old story about the gorlock, the creature with the backward-pointing feet.
        By the end of it, you are looking forward to being sold into slavery and sent to work in the tin mines of Caran Baru.

        The provost marshal is a rich and powerful man, cunning and capable.
        ‘I have need of someone like you,’ he says.
        ‘A group of rebels, loyal to the old king, are hiding out in the Coldbleak Mountains.
        Their leader, Nergan Corin, is dangerous to us, as he is heir to the old throne and a rallying point for the rebels.
        Penetrate their stronghold and slay Nergan Corin, and you will be richly rewarded.
        I can promise you 500 Shards and a title if you succeed.’

        During your short trip upward, the old man regales you with tales of your destiny and fate, continuously arguing with himself as he does so.
        You reach a hill covered with a circle of large obsidian standing stones.
        Despite the bitter wind that blow across these hills the stones are unweathered and seem almost newly lain.
        ‘Here are the Gates of the World.’ says the mad old man.
        The stones are laid in such a way that they form three archways, each carven with mystic symbols and runes of power.
        ‘Each gate will take you to a part of the world of Harkuna, though I know not where,’ explains the old man.
        Abruptly, he turns around and sets off down the hill, babbling to himself.
        His voice fades as he descends the hill, leaving you alone with the brooding stones and the howling wind.

        The Trading Post is a small village, set up here by enterprising settlers from the mainland.
        Its main export appears to be furs from the forest.
        The Mayor, a fat genial fellow, who greets you personally, insists that one day the Trading Post will be a thriving town.
        There is not a lot here yet, however, a small market, a quay, the settler’s houses, and a shrine to Lacuna the Huntress, goddess of nature.

        Gingerly, you open the door.
        It leads to a curtained alcove, through which you observe the room beyond.
        It is a long, low hall – clearly an ancient Uttakin temple, from a time when the Masked Lords of Uttaku ruled all of Harkuna, but now part of the sewers of Yellowport.
        A cheap wooden chair has been placed on the altar to act as a throne.
        On it sits a large and extremely ugly ratman.
        He has a tacky amulet around his neck, and a rusty iron hoop for a crown.
        About four ratmen are kneeling before him, engaged in conversation.
        ‘But, Skabb...’ one of the rat men is saying.
        ‘That’s Great King Skabb to you, dung-breath!!’ bellows the rat on the throne.
