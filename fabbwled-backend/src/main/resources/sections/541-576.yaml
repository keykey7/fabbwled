        Guildmaster Vernon is too busy to see you. It seems he doesn’t want
        to  know  you,  now  that  he  doesn’t  need  you  anymore.
        Such is life.

        The shrine is set in a wooded  grove.  Birds  twitter  in  the  trees,
        and a deer darts away into the forest at you approach.
        A priestess is tending a low altar, where food and drink has been laid out in
        honour of Lacuna, the Goddess of the Wilderness. She  is  the patron
        of  hunters,  trappers,  woodsmen,  and  all  those  who  seek oneness with nature.

#        With a heroic effort, you manage to get to the woman.
#        Gathering her up, you run for the door, and stagger out into
#        the cool night air, smoke and flame licking at your heels.
#        The townsfolk give you a rousing cheer and the girl
#        thanks you effusively for saving her mother.
#        Later, it transpires that the woman is actually a powerful
#        sorceress whose experiments in fire magic went slightly wrong.
#        Her name is Elissia the Traveller and she gives you a gift – a pale moonstone.
#        Note moonstone of teleportation – The War-Torn Kingdom, 650 on your Adventure Sheet.
#        Elissia tells that you can use the moonstone by rubbing it,
#        and you will be instantly teleported to the vicinity of the
#        sunstone – which she carries on a necklace.
#        ‘I will be here in Marlock City. Whenever you are
#        desperate, at the end of your tether, or just want to get
#        here fast,use the moonstone and you will appear beside me. I will do

          You instinct was correct. The sea bed suddenly drops away, to
        reveal the ruins of the Sunken City of Ziusudra. Crumbling
        towers climb out of the hazy green depths, and shoals of flashing
        silverfish dart through the abandoned windows and doors of
        coral-encrusted buildings.The creature you are following arrows down towards a large
        dome-like structure covered in waving tendrils of seaweed. It
        disappears through a hole in the roof of the dome.Carefully, you swim down
        to the hole and look through,into the palace of the repulsive ones.
