        ‘Well, well, well, what have we here, friends?’ asks the old man.
        He seems to be talking to someone next to him, although you
        are certain he is alone. ‘Looks like a washed up adventurer to
        me!’ he says in answer to his own question, ‘all wet and out of
        luck.’
        He carries on having a conversation – a conversation that
        quickly turns into a heated debate. He is clearly quite mad.
        ‘Excuse me, umm, EXCUSE ME!,’ you shout above the
        hubbub in an attempt to grab the old man’s attention. He stops
        and stares at you.
        ‘Is this the Isle of the Druids?’ you ask impatiently.
        ‘Indeed it is,’ says the old man, ‘I see that you are from a far
        land so it is up to me to welcome you to Harkuna. But I think
        you may have much to do here as it is written in the stars that
        someone like you would come. Your destiny awaits you! Follow
        me, young adventurer.’
        The old man turns smartly about and begins walking up a
        path towards some hills. You can just see some sort of
        monolithic stone structure atop one of them.
        ‘Come on, come one, I’ll show you the Gates of the World,’
        the old man babbles.
