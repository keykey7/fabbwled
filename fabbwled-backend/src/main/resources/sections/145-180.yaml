        A man accosts you as you are leaving a tavern. His breath reeks
        of rotting teeth, and his ear has been cut off – the mark of a man
        punished for piracy.
          ‘Give me 10 Shards and I will tell you what you want to
        know,’ he says.

        Pay the money (cross off 10 Shards) turn to 533

        Cross off the 10 Shards. You get a berth on a merchantman 
        headed for Marlock City. It is a trouble-free journey. 
          ‘I pay everyone off – the Sokarans, the pirates,’ says the 
        captain. ‘That way I get left alone.’

        Inside the cave, you find Damor the Hermit, floating cross-
        legged in the air. ‘I told you never to come back!’ he shouts 
        angrily. He waves his hand, and you are teleported back down 
        to the bottom of the mountain before you can say a word.

        The temple of Alvir and Valmir, Divine Rulers of the House of 
        the Sea, is right on the teeming harbour of Marlock City. Its 
        sea-green marbled porticos are draped in a hundred silver nets. 
        Brother and sister, Alvir and Valmir rule below the waves. Alvir 
        brings the souls of the drowned in his nets before his sister, 
        Valmir, for judgement. 
          A swaggering ship’s captain emerges from the temple, saying 
        to you in passing, ‘Never, I mean never go to sea without paying 
        your respects to the twin gods – unless ye want to sail through a 
        world of storms!’

        Blessed Springs are known to be efficacious in this kind of case.’

        The Three Rings Tavern is a comfortable inn near the city 
        centre. The tavern costs you 1 Shard a day. Each day you spend

        of your normal unwounded Stamina score.

        Your mind falls into a waking dream, and you walk lazily into 
        the waters. The mer-folk, laughing and singing, take you down 
        to their undersea home of living coral, where they stop you 
        from drowning with their faery magic. They keep you for 
        several weeks, until you are no longer an amusement to them. 
          You wake up, as is from a long sleep, with only a shadowy 
        memory of your ordeal, to find yourself washed up in the 
        harbour of Yellowport. You have lost all the possessions you 
        were carrying (erase them from your Adventure Sheet) but you 
        still have your money.

        You hold up the pirate captain’s head. The guildmaster looks 
        up expectantly, but his face quickly darkens. 
          ‘This is not Amcha!! Everyone knows he has only one eye – 
        this poor fellow is probably some beggar you killed in an alley 
        somewhere. You think you can swindle the guild with this 
        pathetic ruse! Out! Get out! And don’t come back until you

        You have soon laid the figures out like three logs on the village
        green. They are badly hurt, but still alive. Now that you can get
        better look at them, you see that they are dusted all over with
        flour, giving them a spectral appearance.
          You summon the other villagers. At first they are loath to
        venture out and inspect the three strangers, but the fact that you
        survived convinces them there are no ghosts to worry about.
          ‘Why, it’s Old Megan!’ cries a man as he claps eyes on one
        of the three. ‘And here’s Bradok the miller, and Lame Pootmar!
        Why are they all covered in flour? Where’re the ghosts?’
          You shake your head and sigh at the stupidity of the yokels.

        along.’

          ‘You’d better leave – now. Before I decide you are a spy,

        One of the archers looses a shaft, and an arrow thuds into the

        You step through the archway. Immediately the symbols on the 
        stone begin to glow with red-hot energy; your hair stands on 
        end and your body tingles. A crackling nimbus of blue-white 
        force engulfs you, the sky darkens and thunder and lightning 
        crash and leap across the heavens. Suddenly, your vision fades, 
        and everything goes black. 
          When your sight returns, you find yourself outside the gates 
        of a huge, fortified city. A guard starts in surprise at the sight of 
        you. Then he shakes his head as if to clear it, sure he must have 
        imagined what he just saw!
          The gates open, and a troop of heavy cavalry canter past.
