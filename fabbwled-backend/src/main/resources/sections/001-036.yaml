        The approach of dawn has turned the sky a milky grey-green, like jade. 
        The sea is a luminous pane of silver. Holding the tiller of your sailing boat,  
        you keep your gaze fixed on the glittering constellation known as the Spider.  
        It marks the north, and by keeping it to port you know you are still on course.
        The sun appears in a trembling burst of red fire at the rim of the world. 
        Slowly the chill of night gives way to brazen warmth.You lick your parched lips. 
        There is a little water sloshing in the bottom of the barrel by your feet, but not enough to see you through another day.
        Sealed in a scroll case tucked into your jerkin is the parchment map your grandfather gave to you on his death-bed. 
        You remember his stirring tales of far sea voyages, of kingdoms beyond the western horizon, of sorcerous islands and ruined palaces filled with treasure.  
        As a child you dreamed of nothing else but the magical quests that were in store if you too became an adventurer.
        You never expected to die in an open boat before your adventures even began.
        Securing the tiller, you unroll the map and study it again. You hardly need to. Every detail is etched into your memory by now.  
        According to your reckoning, you should have reached the east coast of Harkuna, the great northern continent, days ago. 
        A pasty grey blob splatters on to the map. 
        After a moment of stunned surprise, you look up and curse the seagull circling directly overhead. Then it strikes you – where there’s a seagull, there may be land.
        You leap to your feet and scan the horizon. 
        Sure enough, aline of white cliffs lie a league to the north. Have you been sailing along the coast all this time without realising the mainland was so close? 
        Steering towards the cliffs, you feel the boat judder against rough waves. 
        A howling wind whips plumes of spindrift across the sea. Breakers pound the high cliffs. The tiller is yanked out of your hands. 
        The little boat is spun around, out of control, and goes plunging in towards the coast. You leap clear at the last second. 
        There is the snap of timber, the roaring crescendo of the waves – and then silence as you gounder.  
        Striking out wildly, you try to swim clear of the razor-sharp rocks. 
        For a while the undertow threatens to drag you down, then suddenly a wave catches you and flings you contemptuously up on to the beach.
        Battered and bedraggled you lie gasping for breath until you hear someone walking along the shore towards you. 
        Wary of danger, you lose  no time in getting to your feet. Confronting you is an old man clad in a dirty loin-cloth.  
        His eyes have a feverish bright look that is suggestive of either a mystic or a mad man.

        You have come to the foothills of the Spine of Harkun, in the north west of Sokara. 
        The view is impressive: a massive wall of forested mountains, whose rocky, white-flanked peaks soar skywards into the clouds.  
        These parts of the mountains are unclimbable but you notice a large cave at the bottom of a mountain.

        You step through the archway. Immediately the symbols on the stone begin to glow with red-hot energy; your hair stands on end and your body tingles. A crackling nimbus of blue-whiteforce engulfs you, the sky darkens and thunder and lightning crash and leap across the heavens.  
        Suddenly, your vision fades, and everything goes black. When your sight returns, you find yourself at the gates of a large city, set on an ochre-coloured river.  
        A vile stink of brimstone permeates the air. 
        You wrinkle your face up in disgust and gag involuntarily. ‘Welcome to Yellowport!’ says a passing merchant.

        If not, read on.A notice has been pinned up in the foyer. ‘Adventurer priest wanted. 
        See the Chief Administrator.
        ’Naturally, you present yourself, and the Chief Administrator,a  grey-whiskered  priest  of  Elnir,  takes  you  into  his  office.  
        He shows  you  a  special  crystal  ball  that  displays  an  aerial  view  of Marlock   City.   
        You   notice   several   strange-looking   clouds hanging  over  the  city.  
        They  are  shaped  like  gigantic  demons reaching down to claw at the city laid out below them.
        ‘The crystal ball shows things as they are in the spirit world,’explains  the  priest.  
        ‘These  storm  demons  cannot  be  seen  under normal  circumstances,  but  they  are  there,  almost  ready  to destroy the city.
        ’He  goes  on  to  tell  you  that  Sul  Veneris,  the  divine  Lord  of Thunder is one of the sons of Elnir, the Sky God, chief among the gods.
        He is responsible for keeping the storm demons under control,  and  thunder  is  thought  to  be  the  sound  of  Sul  Venerissmiting the demons in his wrath.
        ‘Unfortunately,  the  storm  demons  have  found  a  way  to  put Sul  Veneris  into  an  enchanted  sleep.  
        He  lies  at  the  very  top  of Devil’s Peak, a single spire of volcanic rock, reaching up into the clouds. 
        The peak lies north of Marlock City and the Curstmoor. 
        We need an enterprising priest to get to the top of the peak and free Sul Veneris from his sleep.
        But I must warn you that several priests have already tried, and we never saw them again.
        ’If you take up the quest, record the codeword Altitude.

        A narrow path leads up the hill, the top of which is crowned
        with a circle of large obsidian standing stones, hewn from solid
        rock. Despite the bitter wind that blows across these hills, the
        stones are unweathered and seem but newly lain. They form

        You tell them a story of tragic love between a merman and a
        human princess. The mer-folk are moved to shed briny tears,
        and one of them plants a languorous kiss on your lips.
        You find that you can indeed breathe underwater now. The
        mer-folk lead you into the depths, where they swim playfully
        around you.
        Suddenly, a hideous form looms out of the murk. It is like a
        giant squid, but it carries a spear in one of its many tentacles and
        wears rudimentary armour. Great black eyes shine with an
        implacable alien intelligence. The mer-folk dart away in fright,
        leaving you alone with the creature.

        ‘Well, well, well, what have we here, friends?’ asks the old man.
        He seems to be talking to someone next to him, although you
        are certain he is alone. ‘Looks like a washed up adventurer to
        me!’ he says in answer to his own question, ‘all wet and out of
        luck.’
        He carries on having a conversation – a conversation that
        quickly turns into a heated debate. He is clearly quite mad.
        ‘Excuse me, umm, EXCUSE ME!,’ you shout above the
        hubbub in an attempt to grab the old man’s attention. He stops
        and stares at you.
        ‘Is this the Isle of the Druids?’ you ask impatiently.
        ‘Indeed it is,’ says the old man, ‘I see that you are from a far
        land so it is up to me to welcome you to Harkuna. But I think
        you may have much to do here as it is written in the stars that
        someone like you would come. Your destiny awaits you! Follow
        me, young adventurer.’
        The old man turns smartly about and begins walking up a
        path towards some hills. You can just see some sort of
        monolithic stone structure atop one of them.
