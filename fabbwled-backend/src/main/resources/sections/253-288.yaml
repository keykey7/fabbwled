        The provost marshal takes you to an empty side chamber, away
        from prying ears. Over a glass of fine wine you tell him of your
        adventures in the Coldbleak Mountains. When you give him the
        Royal Ring of the House of Corin, he knows that Nergan is
        dead. Cross the royal ring off your Adventure Sheet.
        Marloes Marlock is pleased indeed. He pays you 500 Shards
        and awards you the title Protector of Sokara. Note it in your
        Titles and Honours box. The title will give you instant respect
        and command obedience in Sokara.
        Also, after completing such a difficult test, you find the
        experience has taught you much – gain 1 Rank and roll one die.
        The result is the number of Stamina points you gain
        permanently. Note the increase on your Adventure Sheet. Also,
        don’t forget to increase your Defence by 1 as a result of your
        gain in Rank.

        The king is overjoyed with the news. ‘Excellent! At this rate I
        will be able to take my rightful place in the throne room of Old
        Sokar.’
        He rewards you with the title King’s Champion. Note this
        in the Titles and Honours box on your Adventure Sheet. The
        title comes with a cash gift of 500 Shards as well.
        You also go up one Rank. Roll one die – the result is the
        number of Stamina points you gain permanently. Note the
        increase on your Adventure Sheet. Also, don’t forget to increase
        your Defence by 1 as a result of your gain in Rank.
        The king has another mission for you. He explains that an
        army of steppe Nomads, Trau, Mannekyn people, and Sokaran
        troops still loyal to Nergan, have gathered on the steppes, and
        are moving to siege the Citadel of Velis Corin, which guards the
        Pass of Eagles through the Spine of Harkun. Nergan tells you
        that an alliance of northern nations has declared war on the new
        Sokaran regime. A certain General Beladai leads the Northern
        Alliance, and King Nergan has joined forces with him. He asks
        you to travel to the Steppes and talk to General Beladai.
        ‘An adventurer like yourself might be able to steal into the
        citadel, and bring about its downfall from within, or some such.
        If the citadel falls we will have Sokara at our mercy.’
        If you want to take up this mission for the King, record the
        codeword Assault. When you are ready, you are led back down
        to the foothills of the mountains.

        Becoming an initiate of the Three Fortunes gives you the

        ‘What goes on here?’ you ask. ‘Why do you behave so oddly?’
        The villagers seem quite frightened of you, but one old
        fellow has nerve enough to reply.
        ‘This banquet is for the ghosts of three travellers who lost
        their way in a storm, fell into our millpond and were drowned.’
        ‘When was this?’ you ask.
        ‘Seven years since. They come every year on this night, and
        if we didn’t placate them with victuals and treasure, there’d be a
        mess of trouble.’
        ‘How do you know that?’
        ‘Old Megan told us,’ he says. ‘She knows much about such
        things.’

        You find an open window and squeeze through into a long hall.
        Your foot, however, snags on a thin wire stretched across the
        floor. The wire triggers a loud bell-like gonging that alerts the
        temple. You have little choice but to run for your life – warrior
        priests swarm out of the temple and the iron statues at its gates
        come to life to join in the case.
        Roll a die, and subtract one from the total.

        You remember a bard in a tavern told you about Damor the
        Hermit, and that he knew the secret of the Greatest Story Ever
        Told so you ask him about it.
        ‘Ahh,’ says Damor. ‘I have waited for one such as you.’ He
        tells you the secret of the Greatest Story. ‘Well, my young
        adventurer, destiny beckons, for it is fated that your life will be
        the Greatest Story Ever Told.’
        As you consider this, you feel a sense of momentary
        enlightenment. Gain one Rank and roll one die. The result is
        the number of Stamina points you gain permanently. Also, don’t
        forget to increase your Defence by 1 as a result of your gain in
        Rank.
        ‘Right, that’s that,’ says Damor. ‘Now, go away and don’t
        come back!’
        For a few hours, he lifts the curse that soured your water so
        you can make it down again safely.

        When you and your crew join the fray, the battle is short-lived.
        The pirates are overpowered, though they fight to the last man,
        preferring death to enslavement or execution. The Sokaran
        leader, an admiral in the navy, thanks you gravely for your help.
        He rewards you with a share of the pirates booty – you get 400
        Shards and 1 Cargo Unit of spices, if you have room for it in
        your ship’s hold. You sail on.

        You wait for an hour. At dusk, something emerges. It is the
        gorlock, a beast with legs like a bird, a body like a reptile, with
        two short forelimbs and a beaked, lizard-like head. You see that
        its two legs do have backward pointing feet. The beast heads off
        into the hills, and you creep forwards.

        You end dead in an alleyway with your throat cut. Your
        adventures are over, unless you have a resurrection deal.
