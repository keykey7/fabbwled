A  raven  flutters  tothe  ground  nearby,  eyeing  you  curiously.  His  brothers  cawloudly into the echoing sky. Dusk falls, and in the dim twilight,a herd of horses comes streaking out of the night, straight at you.As they near, it seems to you that their hooves are not touchingthe  ground,  and  from  their  manes  trail  wispy  clouds  of  sparks,like tiny stars.

A  crackling  nimbus  of  blue-whiteforce  engulfs  you,  the  sky  darkens  and  thunder  and  lightningcrash  and  leap  across  the  heavens.  Suddenly,  your  vision  fades,and everything goes black.When your sight returns, you find yourself outside the gatesof a huge, fortified city. A guard starts in surprise at the sight ofyou. Then he shakes his head as if to clear it, sure he must haveimagined what he just saw!The gates open, and a troop of heavy cavalry canter past.‘Make way for the Marlock City militia!’, says the guard.When they have passed, you walk into the city.
