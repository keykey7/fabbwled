        The trau, realizing its fate, sinks into a dark clouding silence.
        You haul it off to the mines where the overseer, a fat, cruel-
        looking man, gives you 150 Shards for the trau.
        You return to town.

        You slip out of your chains, and hide inside an ore-laden 
        miningcart. When it is taken out of the mine, you creep out, 
        and runoff into the hills. Eventually you reach Caran Baru.

        You are standing at the bottom of the Devil’s Peak. It is a
        massive tower of black rock, like a stone tree-trunk, bare and
        branchless, climbing up into the sky. You cannot see the top, for
        it is shrouded in grey clouds. Thunder and lightning play about
        the clouded summit.
        The sides of the peak are almost sheer, but there are many
        hand and footholds. It can be climbed, but only if you have
        some climbing gear. If you have and you want to make the
        ascent, turn to 340. Otherwise, turn to 560.

        You untie the little creature from its bonds. It gives a jubilant
        cry, and soars upwards.
        ‘Thank you, large one!’ it chatters, ‘My name is Pikalik the
        Wing-warrior! We never forget – one day I will pay my debt.’
        With that, he flitters away into the clouds.
        ‘That’s 75 Shards you just let fly away,’ comments the man
        in the palanquin wryly, ‘Mannekyn People can’t be trusted,
        believe me.’
        You leave the slave market.

        A trader from the far north tells a story about a great wizard,
        Targdaz the Magnificent, who was tricked by a shaman of the
        Horde of the Thousand Winds on the Great Steppes.
        ‘He imprisoned Targdaz inside a giant ruby, and proceeded
        to loot Targdaz’s tower. But in his stupidity, he opened the great
        wizard’s Casket of Imponderables, and unleashed a terrible storm
        that swept across the steppes, scattering many of the tribes far
        and wide. The shaman was killed, of course, but as far as anyone
        knows, Targdaz is still trapped in the ruby, waiting patiently for
        release – perhaps for another hundred years, who knows? One
        thing’s for certain – it won’t be me trying to get him out!’

        You feel a wrenching moment of disorientation, and then you
        suddenly appear with a flash beside a ruined, burnt-out city. A
        passing builder stares at you in horror, unsure whether you are a
        human or a demon. Quickly, you hurry away.

        You fall into the yawning blackness with a despairing cry. You
        plummet like a stone through the air for what seems like an age.
        You are engulfed in absolute darkness, and all you can hear is
        the whistling of the wind past your ears.
        Suddenly you shoot into bright sunlight, and land with an
        almighty splash into the sea! Coughing and spluttering, you rise
        to the surface. You are not far from a forested island, and you
        swim for shore. A small settlement crowds the shore – it looks
        like you have arrived at the Trading Post on the Isle of Druids.
