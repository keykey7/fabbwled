        Your men have been fishing with a net. This time, however,
        they have caught a large shark. Afterwards, when it has been cut

        a grotto in the wall contains an idol made from sea-shells and

        fail a SCOUTING roll. It is good for only one reroll. When you
        use the blessing, cross it off your Adventure Sheet. Once it is
