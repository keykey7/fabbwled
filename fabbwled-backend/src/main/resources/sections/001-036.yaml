        You come to the top of a windswept cliff. An ancient pillar of
        jumbled rock, pitted and weatherbeaten, stands at the cliffâ€™s
        edge, like a broken finger pointing at the sky. Seagulls sing their
        song of desolation in the air.
        Judging by the runes etched into the rock, the tor dates back
        to the time of the Shadar, a race that ruled Harkuna so long ago,
        they are lost in myth and legend.
