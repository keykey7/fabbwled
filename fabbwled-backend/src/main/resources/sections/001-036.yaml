        You head across the hot, dusty and sparsely vegetated land.
        Vultures circle overhead – presumably they think you’re going
        to die. You wander on, until you come to a ridge. Down
        below, in a shallow valley, is a great mound of earth. Scorpion
        men crawl in and out of the many burrows that riddle the earth.
        The number of scorpion men in the valley makes your heart
        quail; unless you have the codeword Artefact, the place is too
        deadly to enter.
