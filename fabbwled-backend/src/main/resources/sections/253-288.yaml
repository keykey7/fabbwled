        To renounce the worship of Lacuna, you must pass an ordeal of
        judgment. This entails the high priestess throwing several silver
        daggers at you, while you remain motionless.
        ‘If Lacuna sees it in her heart to forgive you, the daggers will
        all miss,’ she claims.

        A large island made of reeds and plants, which grow out of a
        massive floating bed of kelp, drifts aimlessly across the waters. As
        you draw near, you see that a number of people have made their
        home there. The inhabitants hail you, and invite you ashore.
        Turn to 537.

        You find a natural alcove in the wall of a tunnel. Desperately,
        you squeeze yourself into it, and fade into the shadows. The
        ratmen come bundling past, whooping and yelling. None of
        them spot you, and once they have gone you step out, smiling
        to yourself.

        What you have just done is probably a sacrilege, desecrating the
        Temple of Tyrnai, but you don’t care. You sneak out of the
        temple unseen, and head back to town with your prize. Who
        else could have stolen something from right under the noses of
        the warrior priests of Tyrnai!

        Your tale of valour and derring-do falls on an unappreciative
        audience. The mer-folk slip beneath the waves with snorts of
        derision, leaving you alone on the desolate beach. There is
        nothing for you to do but return to the clifftop tor.

        ‘What goes on here?’ you ask. ‘Why do you behave so oddly?’
        The villagers seem quite frightened of you, but one old
        fellow has nerve enough to reply.
        ‘This banquet is for the ghosts of three travellers who lost
        their way in a storm, fell into our millpond and were drowned.’
        ‘When was this?’ you ask.
        ‘Seven years since. They come every year on this night, and
        if we didn’t placate them with victuals and treasure, there’d be a
        mess of trouble.’
        ‘How do you know that?’
        ‘Old Megan told us,’ he says. ‘She knows much about such
        things.’
