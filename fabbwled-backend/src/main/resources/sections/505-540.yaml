        With that, it rolls over, and dives down into the lake.

        You come round inside a disused warehouse, enmeshed in the
        net. You have been stripped of all your possessions – they are in
        a tidy pile nearby. Several men surround you. They are dressed
        in furs and robes that are adorned with hundreds of multi-
        coloured feathers. Each man wears a necklace of animal skulls
        and has his teeth sharpened to needle-like points.
        ‘Hallo,’ the leader says reasonably. ‘We are the Unspeakable
        Ones – it is our way to eat people in sacrifice of our god.’
        He points to a squat wooden idol of a grossly fat half-man,
        half ape with ivory needles for teeth. You notice the name
        ‘Badogor the Unspoken’ inscribed on a plaque at the base of the
        idol.
        ‘Badogor the Unspoken - who’s he?’ you ask.
        ‘Do not speak his name!’ shouts the cannibal, ‘Or you will
        be forever cursed!’
        You notice a large cauldron of boiling water into which
        another cultist is tossing herbs and garlic. He stares at you and
        licks his lips.
