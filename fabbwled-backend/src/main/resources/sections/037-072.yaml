        Your men have been fishing with a net. This time, however,
        they have caught a large shark. Afterwards, when it has been cut
        open, you find the remains of some poor sailor. Inside his leather
        pouch, you find a bag of pearls, which you can take if you
        wish.

        The inside of the dome is lit with an eerie yellowish glow that
        comes from the sea-moss that carpets the ceiling. At the far end,
        a grotto in the wall contains an idol made from sea-shells and
        coral, presumably of Oannes, the god of the repulsive ones. At
        its feet lies the golden net of Alvir and Valmir, the object of
        your quest. Between you and it swim several of the giant squid-
        creatures, carrying out various undersea chores.

        You decide that discretion would be the better part of valour in

        swagger past. Nothing else happens tonight.

        The new provost marshal of Yellowport is Royzer – he used to
        be Marloes Marlock’s second in command. Since the
        assassination of the old provost, Royzer has ruled the city with
        an iron hand – patrols are frequent and spies are everywhere.
        You will have to be careful not to get yourself recognised.

        A strange-looking craft is bobbing in the water. It is shaped like
        a cone, floating on its base, and as you draw nearer, you realize
        it is made entirely of metal! Its sail, a huge piece of cloth, seems
        to have collapsed and is spread out around it, on the surface of
        the sea. Great blue and white letters, in some foreign script, are
        painted on its side. You notice an opening on one side.

        A small boy runs up to you, saying ‘Help us, help us! The
        Man-eating Blood-Thursday Gob-gobbler has got my little
        sister!’
        His mother, a flaxen-haired beauty, comes up behind him.
        ‘Surely, you mean blood-thirsty not Thursday,’ you ask.
        ‘Oh no,’ replies the young mother, ‘the Man-eating Blood-
        Thursday Gob-gobbler is so named because it hunts only on
        Thursdays!’
        The boy’s name is Mikail, and his mother is Lynn. Her
        husband is away in the army, and her young daughter, Haylie,
        was taken by the beast last Thursday. Apparently, several people
        have disappeared, never to be seen again.
        ‘Please, help us!’ plead the villagers.

        You stand your ground. The ghostly horses stream past you on
        either side, neighing wildly at the sky. Nimbly, you leap at one,
        and manage to wrap your arms around its neck, and swing on to
        its back. The horse feels quite solid, but appears to be a
        luminous, pale-green colour. You look up through a cloud of
        sparks emanating from the horse’s mane just in time to see a
        rocky wall of a low hill looming up out of the evening mist.
        Your horse is galloping full tilt right into it!

        Nagil is the Lord of the Lands of the Dead, and his temple in
        Marlock City is covered in friezes and gargoyles of ornate
        design, depicting the souls of the dead on their journey to the
        underworld. Inside, it is cool and dark, hung with black velvet
        drapes.
        A scroll tacked to the wall reads: ‘Wanted: person of unusual
