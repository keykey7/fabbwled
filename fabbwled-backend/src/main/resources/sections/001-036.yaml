        You have come to the foothills of the Spine of Harkun, in the north west of Sokara. 
        The view is impressive: a massive wall of forested mountains, whose rocky, white-flanked peaks soar skywards into the clouds.  
        These parts of the mountains are unclimbable but you notice a large cave at the bottom of a mountain.
