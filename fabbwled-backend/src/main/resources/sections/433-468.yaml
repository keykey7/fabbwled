        You creep past a scorpion man guard, which is dozing at the entrance to one of the burrows. 
        The stench inside the mound is foul – a kind of acrid, rotting vegetable smell.
        You head for the centre of the mound, past tunnels, rooms and egg chambers, avoiding the inhabitants by skulking in the shadows.
        Finally, you come to a room which is more like the laboratory of a sorcerer than a scorpion den – jars, alembics and scrolls lie all over the place.
        A scorpion man is at work at a desk. Unlike others of his kind, he wears rudimentary clothing.
        Suddenly, what you took for a stuffed animal’s head,mounted on the wall, says, ‘There is an intruder, master.’
        The scorpion man wheels around and charges straight at you!
