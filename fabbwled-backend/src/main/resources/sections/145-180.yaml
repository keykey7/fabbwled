        The priest looks you over. ‘I’m afraid we have no one skilled
        enough to cure you. However, I believe the Temple of Maka in 
        Yellowport might be able to help. And the holy waters at 
        Blessed Springs are known to be efficacious in this kind of case.’

        You hold up the pirate captain’s head. The guildmaster looks 
        up expectantly, but his face quickly darkens. 
        ‘This is not Amcha!! Everyone knows he has only one eye – 
        this poor fellow is probably some beggar you killed in an alley 
        somewhere. You think you can swindle the guild with this 
        pathetic ruse! Out! Get out! And don’t come back until you 
        bring me the head of Amcha One-Eye!’ 
        The guildmaster has you removed by his guards, and you are 
        dumped into the street.

        A Sokaran war galley hails you and draws up alongside. ‘We’re 
        coming aboard for an inspection!’ yells the captain of the galley. 
        His men attempt to grapple your ship.

        You lose your pursuers in the treacherous rocky passes of the 
        mountains. Eventually, you reach the safety of the foothills.

        You have soon laid the figures out like three logs on the village
        green. They are badly hurt, but still alive. Now that you can get
        better look at them, you see that they are dusted all over with
        flour, giving them a spectral appearance.
        You summon the other villagers. At first they are loath to
        venture out and inspect the three strangers, but the fact that you
        survived convinces them there are no ghosts to worry about.
        ‘Why, it’s Old Megan!’ cries a man as he claps eyes on one
        of the three. ‘And here’s Bradok the miller, and Lame Pootmar!
        Why are they all covered in flour? Where’re the ghosts?’
        You shake your head and sigh at the stupidity of the yokels.
        ‘There weren’t any ghosts,’ you explain. ‘It was these three all
        along.’

        You find yourself washed up on a rocky shore, battered and
        cold, but lucky to be alive. You haul yourself up the beach on to
        land. Fortunately for you, you find the village of Blessed Springs.

        You claim that you have come to swear allegiance to Nergan, 
        the rightful king of Sokara. Captain Vorkung is not convinced. 
        He narrows his eyes suspiciously.
        ‘You’d better leave – now. Before I decide you are a spy, 
        and have you shot!’
        One of the archers looses a shaft, and an arrow thuds into the 
        ground at your feet, quivering menacingly.
        You realize it is time to leave, and climb down the 
        mountain.

        You step through the archway. Immediately the symbols on the 
        stone begin to glow with red-hot energy; your hair stands on 
        end and your body tingles. A crackling nimbus of blue-white 
        force engulfs you, the sky darkens and thunder and lightning 
        crash and leap across the heavens. Suddenly, your vision fades, 
        and everything goes black. 
        When your sight returns, you find yourself outside the gates 
        of a huge, fortified city. A guard starts in surprise at the sight of 
        you. Then he shakes his head as if to clear it, sure he must have 
        imagined what he just saw!
        The gates open, and a troop of heavy cavalry canter past.
        ‘Make way for the Marlock City militia!’, says the guard.
        When they have passed, you walk into the city.
