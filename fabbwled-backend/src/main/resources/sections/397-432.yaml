        The gloomy wreck is filled with coral-encrusted skeletons of its drowned crew. 
        You find the captain’s cabin. Inside, a figure still sits in a chair, a chest of gems at its feet. 
        With a thrill of horror, you realize it is a ghost, an undead remnant of a pirate captain, steeped in evil, its nacreous, fish-gnawed flesh still pulsing with a kind of half-life.

        One of the cultists of Badogor the Unspoken is feigning distress
        in the hope of luring a sacrificial victim for dinner. He sits up
        when he recognizes you as a member of the cult, and says, rather
        disconsolately, ‘Ah, hallo friend. We were hoping for a big
        banquet tonight.’
        Two more cultists step from the shadows, holding a net. ‘Oh
        well, perhaps another will come along,’ one of them says
        optimistically.
        They treat you as one of their own – even giving you a share
        of the cult’s recent income. You get 20 Shards.
        ‘May you never speak his name,’ they intone in parting.
        You return to the city centre
