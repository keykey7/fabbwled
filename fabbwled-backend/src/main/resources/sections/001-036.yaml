        You tell them a story of tragic love between a merman and a
        human princess. The mer-folk are moved to shed briny tears,
        and one of them plants a languorous kiss on your lips.
        You find that you can indeed breathe underwater now. The
        mer-folk lead you into the depths, where they swim playfully
        around you.
        Suddenly, a hideous form looms out of the murk. It is like a
        giant squid, but it carries a spear in one of its many tentacles and
        wears rudimentary armour. Great black eyes shine with an
        implacable alien intelligence. The mer-folk dart away in fright,
        leaving you alone with the creature.
