        It is said that the god, Sig, in his aspect as the Divine Bard, passed this knowledge to a mystic called Damor theHermit.
        He lives alone in a lost cave, awaiting the day when he can pass on the story to the one who finds him.
        ‘I am too old now to pursue the quest – so I pass it on to you.
        I believe he can be found in the foothills of the Spine of Harkun, the mountains to the north.
        If you find Damor you will become a great Troubadour!’
