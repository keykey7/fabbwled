        You grab the woman’s wrist a split-second before she can cut
        the strings of your money pouch. You drag her around to face
        you, but she meets your outraged scowl with a swashbuckling
        grin.
        ‘You’ve got good reflexes,’ she says. ‘Most of the street scum
        around here are too drink-sodden or dimwitted to notice the
        loss of a few Shards. Want to earn some real money?’

        The temple of the Three Fortunes is a squat, square building. A
        frieze above the door depicts three woman weaving a tapestry.
        ‘That’s the Tapestry of Fate, where our destiny is woven,’
        comments a priest.

        You are greeted warmly and politely by the provost marshal
        who treats you as one if his own. However, there are no more
        missions, and after thanking you once again, he politely sends
        you on your way.

        The soldier recognizes you and bows.
        ‘My lord,’ he says, ‘We are a small group now, left here to
        act as raiders behind enemy lines. Thanks to your heroic actions,
        the Citadel of Velis Corin is now ours – the king has moved his
        court there. Go to the citadel if you would speak with the king.’
        There is nothing else of interest in the mountains, so you
        return to the foothills.
