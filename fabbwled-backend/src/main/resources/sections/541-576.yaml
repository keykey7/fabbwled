        All shipping in and out of Yellowport must come through the
        offices of the harbourmaster. Here you can buy passage to 
        farlands, or even a ship of your own, to fill with cargo and crew.
        
        If you buy a ship, you are the captain and can take it where you wish,
        exploring or trading. Three types of ship are available:
        
        The War-Torn Kingdom 53 Barque, 250 Shards, 1 Cargo Unit
        Brigantine, 450 Shards, 2 Cargo Units
        Galleon, 900 Shards, 3 Cargo Units
        
        If you buy a ship, add it to the Ship’s Manifest, and name it as
        you wish. The quality of the ship’s crew is poor, unless you
        upgrade it. If you already own a ship you can sell it back to the
        harbourmaster at half the above prices.
        It costs 50 Shards to upgrade a poor crew to average, and
        100 Shards to upgrade an average crew to good. Excellent
        quality is not available in Yellowport.
        
        If you own a ship, you can buy as many Cargo Units as it has
        room for. You may also sell cargo, if you have any. Prices are for
        single Cargo Units.
        Cargo, To buy, To sell
        Furs, 190 Shards, 170 Shards
        Grain, 200 Shards, 180 Shards

        The merchants’ guild of Marlock City is a large, many-storeyed
        building of marble. Inside, many clerks and scribes are at work.
        Here you can bank your money for safekeeping, or invest it in
        guild enterprises in the hope of making a profit. A sign on the
        guildmaster’s door reads ‘Help wanted.’

        You open the door on to a large dining hall and kitchen. About
        thirty ratmen are standing around, eating and drinking.
        Everything goes quiet as they turn to stare at you with their
        black beady eyes.
        ‘Er, I do have an invitation,’ you stutter, holding up the
        note.
        ‘And we’d love to have you for dinner,’ one of them snarls.
        
        Yelling noisily, they charge toward you. You have little
        choice but to turn and flee for your life! You race down the
        sewer tunnels, with the ratmen in hot pursuit.

        To renounce the worship of the Three Fortunes, you will have
        to undergo a ritual.
        ‘We must determine what the Three Fortunes have to say
        about the matter,’ says the high priest.
        Roll one die. On a 1 or a 2, you are free to go, on a 3 or 4
        you must pay 25 Shards in compensation, and on 5 or 6, they
        demand a sacrifice of some of your blood – lose 1 Stamina point.
        Do you want to reconsider? If you are determined to
        renounce your faith, pay whatever price the die dictates, and
        delete The Three Fortunes from the God box on your
        Adventure Sheet.

        ‘Ah, the saviour of the citadel. What can I do for you?’ asks the
        general.
        He can arrange for you to be healed of all your wounds,
        cured of poison and disease (but his court sorcerer cannot lift a
        curse).
        If you have no weapons or armour anywhere at all, he will
        give you an ordinary sword and a suit of chain mail
        (Defence+1). If you are completely out of money, with no
        Shards either banked or invested with the merchants’ guild, or
        stored at a town house, he will give you 200 Shards.
        ‘Any time you are in real need, just come to me,’ he adds.

        You hand him the black dragon shield. Cross it off your
        Adventure Sheet, and lose the codeword Axe.
        ‘You are indeed worthy,’ he says.
        ‘And will you teach me your fighting arts?’ you ask.
        ‘You have already learned all I can teach you,’ he says.
        You realise that what he says is true – your defeat of the
        Black Dragon Knight has taught you much. Gain 1 Rank and
        roll one die. The score is the number of Stamina points you can
        add to your unwounded total, permanently. Also, don’t forget to
        increase your Defence by 1 as a result of your gain in Rank.
        You look up, but Yanryt the Son has gone.

        You are up the Stinking River, near its source – the Lake of the
