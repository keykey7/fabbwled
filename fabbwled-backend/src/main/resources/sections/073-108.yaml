        A fisherman will take you all the way to Yellowport for 15
        Shards. Cross the money of your Adventure Sheet. Amazingly,
        despite the apparent fragility of the small vessel,
        you arrive without incident.

        You grab the woman’s wrist a split-second before she can cut
        the strings of your money pouch. You drag her around to face
        you, but she meets your outraged scowl with a swashbuckling
        grin.
        ‘You’ve got good reflexes,’ she says. ‘Most of the street scum
        around here are too drink-sodden or dimwitted to notice the
        loss of a few Shards. Want to earn some real money?’

        The temple of the Three Fortunes is a squat, square building. A

        Marlock City is a huge sprawling metropolis, enclosed in a
        fortified wall said to have been built one thousand years ago by
        the ancient Shadar Empire. It is the capital city of Sokara.
        Marlock City was once known as Sokar, until General Grieve
        Marlock led the army in bloody revolt against the old king,
        Corin VII, and had him executed. The general renamed the city
        after himself – it is now a crime to call it Sokar.
        The general lives in the old king’s palace, and calls himself
        the Protector-General of all Sokara. Whereas the old king was
        corrupt, the general rules with a fist of iron. Some people like
        the new regime; others are royalists, still loyal to Nergan, the
        heir to the throne, who has gone into hiding somewhere.
        Outside the city gates hang the bodies of many dead people
        – labels around their necks read: ‘Rebels, executed by the state
        for the good of the people’.
        ‘You’d best behave yourself if you don’t want to end up like
        one of them,’ grates a guardsman, nodding towards the swinging
        corpses, as you pass through the great eagle-headed gates of
        Marlock City.
