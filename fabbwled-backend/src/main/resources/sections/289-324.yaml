The locals are behaving very oddly. You watch the villagers lay out a fine feast on the village green. A pig is set roasting on a spit, loaves of freshly baked bread are piled beside bowls overflowing with fruits, butter and cheese. Lastly, the richest merchants of the village bring coffers full of silver which they set beside the table. To your amazement, instead of sitting down to dine, the villagers then scurry home and start closing the shutters on their windows.

A brave adventurer like yourself could get rich it you killed it. You’d be doing us a favour as well.’ You ask what a gorlock looks like, but no one knows. ‘Nobody’s come back to tell the tale!’ says the innkeeper. You leave the tavern.
