        As you stride forward, they look up with expressions of
        luminous rage.

        You jump into the air, and hit the ground rolling. You come
        up, bruised but alive, in time to see the horses ride straight into
        the rocky wall of a low hill! To your amazement, they pass
        straight through the rock and disappear. Silence falls across the
        land like a blanket. There is no sign of them, not even tracks.
        You camp for the night and the next day set off once more.

        Soon you realize you are completely lost in this strange, magical
        forest. You wander around for days, barely able to find enough
        food and water. Lose 4 Stamina points. If you still live, you
        eventually stagger out of the forest to the coast.
