        A fisherman will take you all the way to Yellowport for 15
        Shards. Cross the money of your Adventure Sheet. Amazingly,
        despite the apparent fragility of the small vessel, you arrive
        without incident.

        The high priest takes you to a private chamber.
        ‘You may be just what the temple needs,’ he says, ‘a good,
        old-fashioned thief! There is a suit of armour made entirely of
        gold – ceremonial only of course. Nevertheless, we would like
        to, er, have it donated to us.’
        ‘I see,’ you reply, ‘and where is the armour?’
        ‘Well that’s the tricky part – it’s in the Temple of Tyrnai, in
        Caran Baru. In fact, it’s worn by the idol of Tyrnai himself in
        the temple! Can you bring us the gold chain mail of Tyrnai? In
        return, we will instruct you in the roguish arts.’

        You grab the woman’s wrist a split-second before she can cut
        the strings of your money pouch. You drag her around to face
        you, but she meets your outraged scowl with a swashbuckling
        grin.
        ‘You’ve got good reflexes,’ she says. ‘Most of the street scum
        around here are too drink-sodden or dimwitted to notice the
        loss of a few Shards. Want to earn some real money?’

        The temple of the Three Fortunes is a squat, square building. A
        frieze above the door depicts three woman weaving a tapestry.
        ‘That’s the Tapestry of Fate, where our destiny is woven,’
        comments a priest.

        The soldier recognizes you and bows.
        ‘My lord,’ he says, ‘We are a small group now, left here to
        act as raiders behind enemy lines. Thanks to your heroic actions,
        the Citadel of Velis Corin is now ours – the king has moved his
        court there. Go to the citadel if you would speak with the king.’
        There is nothing else of interest in the mountains, so you
        return to the foothills.
