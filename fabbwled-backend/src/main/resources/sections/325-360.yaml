        You follow the footprints to the mill,
        where you see an old lady and two men brushing flour off their clothes.
        ‘Another successful year’s haunting!’ laughs the woman.
        Quietly you creep back and tell the villagers what you have discovered.
        Brimming with outrage, they go straight to the mill and seize the three miscreants.
        ‘Old Megan!’ cries one of the villagers when he sees who is the ring leader of the three.
        ‘So, you’ve been masquerading as a ghost for these seven years, eh?
        Well, tomorrow we’ll take you to the gallows and then you can play the part for real.

        The captain eyes your crew, and your marines.
        They are at ough-looking lot, seasoned sailors and veterans of quite a few battles at sea.
        ‘Bah!’ he exclaims, ‘It’s not worth the trouble. I’ll let it pass this time.
        ’With that, he returns to his ship, and departs

        You hear an interesting story about one of Baroness Ravayne’s knights, in Golnir.
        Apparently he is plotting against her! ‘Intrigue and treachery in the court of the baroness...’
        mutters a man before his voice fades to a whisper. You leave the tavern.

        A ship, impaled on some rocks, is breaking up.
        Nothing remains save for rotten timbers.
        However, a little bottle is bobbing in the waves.
        Inside, a message reads, ‘Never sail at night through rocky waters.’
        You sail on.

        You are too fast to get caught,
        and run off into the shadowy backstreets of Caran Baru.
        Cursing your luck, you consider your next move.

        You mutter an enchantment that is intended to give you the appearance
        of a rat man but you get some of the intricate syllables wrong,
        and take on the appearance of a particularly wealthy merchant!
        At the sight of you, the rat men redouble their efforts, and you are overwhelmed
        by sheer numbers

        The moon begins to rise, making the ghosts seem to glow.
        They sit hunched over their feast like vultures,
        occasionally stirring their hands in the pile of silver coins and tittering eerily.

        You have no luck in tracking down the ghoul.
        The next day, you hear a rumour doing the rounds in the taverns.
        A ghoul was found and destroyed by an adventuring priestess of Tyrnai
        – apparently, the temple of Nagil rewarded her handsomely. 
        Looks like you were pipped at the post.
