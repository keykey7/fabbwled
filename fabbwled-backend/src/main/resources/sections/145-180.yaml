        The priest looks you over. ‘I’m afraid we have no one skilled
        enough to cure you. However, I believe the Temple of Maka in 
        Yellowport might be able to help. And the holy waters at 
        Blessed Springs are known to be efficacious in this kind of case.’

        You hold up the pirate captain’s head. The guildmaster looks 
        up expectantly, but his face quickly darkens. 
        ‘This is not Amcha!! Everyone knows he has only one eye – 
        this poor fellow is probably some beggar you killed in an alley 
        somewhere. You think you can swindle the guild with this 
        pathetic ruse! Out! Get out! And don’t come back until you 
        bring me the head of Amcha One-Eye!’ 
        The guildmaster has you removed by his guards, and you are 
        dumped into the street.

        You have soon laid the figures out like three logs on the village
        green. They are badly hurt, but still alive. Now that you can get
        better look at them, you see that they are dusted all over with
        flour, giving them a spectral appearance.
        You summon the other villagers. At first they are loath to
        venture out and inspect the three strangers, but the fact that you
        survived convinces them there are no ghosts to worry about.
        ‘Why, it’s Old Megan!’ cries a man as he claps eyes on one
        of the three. ‘And here’s Bradok the miller, and Lame Pootmar!
        Why are they all covered in flour? Where’re the ghosts?’
        You shake your head and sigh at the stupidity of the yokels.
        ‘There weren’t any ghosts,’ you explain. ‘It was these three all
        along.’

        land. Fortunately for you, you find the village of Blessed Springs.

A greatrolling  expanse  of  blasted heath stretches before you. Greyclouds hang over a mournful, dirty-water   coloured   plain,studded  with  rocky  outcrops  and  low  hills.  A  raven  flutters  tothe  ground  nearby,  eyeing  you  curiously.  His  brothers  cawloudly into the echoing sky. Dusk falls, and in the dim twilight,a herd of horses comes streaking out of the night, straight at you.As they near, it seems to you that their hooves are not touchingthe  ground,  and  from  their  manes  trail  wispy  clouds  of  sparks,like tiny stars.
