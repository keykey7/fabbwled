        You inch your way slowly around the edge of the old temple.
        Suddenly, you burst out of the shadows and cut the king down,
        catching the ratmen by surprise.
        At the sight of you standing over their dead king, the four
        remaining ratmen flee in terror. Without their king, they have
        no spirit for a fight.

        You recognise the two iron statues of bull-men that guard the
        temple. They are golems, creatures created by powerful sorcery.
        They will animate and attempt to kill any intruders that steal
        into the temple. Golems are almost impossible to defeat in
        combat, but they have one weakness – a ceramic plug, about the
        size of an apple, set into the backs of their heads. If the plug can
        be pulled out, the enchanted liquid that energizes the golem will
        pour out, and the creature will die.
        That night, you resolve to try to get on to the roof of the
        temple, hang down from the gables above the entrance, and pull
        the plugs on the golems, before going for the chain mail.

        If there is a tick in the box, you find nothing of interest at the
        market – turn back to 400 immediately. Otherwise, put a tick in
        the box and read on.
        At nightfall, the market is kept open for a special sale. A cage
        with a steel floor is wheeled out. Inside is a dark, manlike shape.
        It seems to radiate shadows, for you can barely make it out.
        The slaver says, ‘A trau, ladies and gentlemen. Excellent
        miners, though they have to be chained with cold iron at all
        times.’
        The price is 100 Shards.

        As you draw nearer, you see that the pennants all represent
        different coloured dragons – the red dragon, black dragon, green
        dragon and so on. Outside the gates, a jousting list has been set
        up, and a few warriors are trying their hand against some knights
        who have dragon symbols on their shields.
        A knight, in full plate armour, rides up and says, ‘Welcome
        to the Castle of the Dragon Knights. It is our custom to joust
        against all who would come here – for a wager, of course.’
        He explains that you must bet the weapon and the suit of
        armour that you will use for the joust. If you lose, you forfeit the
        weapon and armour. If you win, you get the armour and
        weapon of the knight you defeat. Most of your potential
        opponents, you note, would be using a sword and plate armour.

            The priestess, who is wearing the skin of a wolf, and is
