        ‘Welcome to the City of the Trees,’ says a passing woman,
        dressed in the garb of a druid.

        The city has been built amid the branches of several mighty
        oaks. Ladders run up and down the trees to houses that perch
        like nests in the branches. You are not allowed into any houses,
        but the druids allow you to barter at the market.

        You have no luck in tracking down the ghoul.
        The next day, you hear a rumour doing the rounds in the taverns.
        A ghoul was found and destroyed by an adventuring priestess of Tyrnai
        – apparently, the temple of Nagil rewarded her handsomely. 
        Looks like you were pipped at the post.
